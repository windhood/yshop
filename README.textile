Installing Redis
Resque requires Redis 0.900 or higher.

Resque uses Redis' lists for its queues. It also stores worker state data in Redis.

Homebrew

If you're on OS X, Homebrew is the simplest way to install Redis:

$ brew install redis
$ redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
You now have a Redis daemon running on 6379.

Via Resque

Resque includes Rake tasks (thanks to Ezra's redis-rb) that will install and run Redis for you:

$ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/resque.git
$ cd resque
$ rake redis:install dtach:install
$ rake redis:start
Or, if you don't have admin access on your machine:

$ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/resque.git
$ cd resque
$ PREFIX=<your_prefix> rake redis:install dtach:install
$ rake redis:start
You now have Redis running on 6379. Wait a second then hit ctrl-\ to detach and keep it running in the background.

The demo is probably the best way to figure out how to put the parts together. But, it's not that hard.

Bundle install

bundle exec rake db:migrate

bundle exec rake db:seed
